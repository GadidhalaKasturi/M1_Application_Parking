# Introduction

In tnis project, a version of parking system program in c is developed which will perform parking system depending on the input from the customer.

# Objective :

The main objective of the project is to perform a parking system to make the best parking  for the customers. To make the vehicles easy to park.

# Features :

This project supports the following types of parking system :
1. Administrator
2. Collect total no. of vehicles parked
3. how many 2 wheeler & 4 wheeler.
4. Collect both customer and vehicle details
5. start time and end time.
6. payment details.
7. exit

# Why:
  1. To reduce the complexity of parking space.
  2. Iâ€™m making this application for vehicles safe and security .
  3. It can be used by anyone for parking their vehicles.
# Where:
  1. This can be used in our daily lives at any where.
  2. We can use it mostly on airport,busstations and other private parking places.
#  Who:
  1. It can be used by anyone.
  2. Can be used as a safe and security for their vehicles.
# When :
  1. One can use anywhere for parking.
  2. The project can be useful for all for parking the vehicles.
# How:
  1. By parking all the vehicles one can find their desired output.
  2. It will be helpful in performing parkedspace calculate and safe. This will give accurate results.
  
# SWOT Analysis

# Strengths
  1. Perform parking system easily
  2. It can calculate parking space and time and cost.
# Weakness
  1. It can perform various calculaions also.

# Opportunities :
  1. It is the safe and secure for all the vehciles at one place
  2. It can be most useful in airports and Railway stations and others.
 
# Threats :
   Advanced feature parking systems are already exist.

OPERATING SYSTEM |   Windows 10
FRONT END	       |   Visual Studio Code

# 2_Module :

1. Admin
2. Customer details
3. No. of vehicles parked
4. Display order in which vehicls are parked
5. Departure of vehicles
6. Check history

# 3_Interface :

User Interface :- In which it consists all the details of parking system.
1. Login to admin where we can see the details of the customer parking details.
2. Such as no. of Vehicles parked.
3. Display order in which vehicles are parked.
4. Departure of vehicle and check history 
5. Exit

# 4_Integration :

Integration is a key software development life cycle (SDLC) strategy. Generally, small software systems are integrated and tested in a single phase, whereas larger systems involve several integration phases to build a complete system, such as integrating modules into low-level subsystems for integration with larger subsystems.

# 5_Testing Process :

Testing is a process to show the correctness of the program. Testing is needed to show completness, it improve the quality of the software and to provide the maintenance aid. Some testing standards are therefore necessary reduce the testing costs and operation time.
Testing software extends throughout the coding phase and it represents the ultimate review of configurations, design and coding. Based on the way the software reacts to these testing,we can deccide whether the configuration that has been built be study or not.
All components of an appplication are tested, as the failure to do so many results in a series of bugs after the software is put to use.
1. Black box Testing
2. white box Testing

**Software Testing Strategies:**
Testing :
1. Unit Testing  :- The purpose of unit testing is to ensure that each program is fully tested.
2. Integration Testing  :- In this individual program units or programs are integrated and as a complete system to ensure that the software requriments are met.
3. Acceptance Testing   :- It involves planning and the execution of varioustypes of tests in order to demonstrate that the implemented software system satisfies the requriments. Finally our project meets the requriments after going all the testing.

 # 6_Functional Requriements :

1. Admin need to enter all the details of the registration.
2. Admin need to insert all details about vehicle.
3. Admin need to save all the details of the customer and vehicle.
4. Admin must generate report for payment.
