1. Login to admin where we can see the details of the customer parking details.
2. Such as no. of Vehicles parked.
3. Display order in which vehicles are parked.
4. Departure of vehicle and check history 
5. Exit

# 4_Integration :

Integration is a key software development life cycle (SDLC) strategy. Generally, small software systems are integrated and tested in a single phase, whereas larger systems involve several integration phases to build a complete system, such as integrating modules into low-level subsystems for integration with larger subsystems.

# 5_Testing Process :

Testing is a process to show the correctness of the program. Testing is needed to show completness, it improve the quality of the software and to provide the maintenance aid. Some testing standards are therefore necessary reduce the testing costs and operation time.
Testing software extends throughout the coding phase and it represents the ultimate review of configurations, design and coding. Based on the way the software reacts to these testing,we can deccide whether the configuration that has been built be study or not.
All components of an appplication are tested, as the failure to do so many results in a series of bugs after the software is put to use.
1. Black box Testing
2. white box Testing

**Software Testing Strategies:**
Testing :
1. Unit Testing  :- The purpose of unit testing is to ensure that each program is fully tested.
2. Integration Testing  :- In this individual program units or programs are integrated and as a complete system to ensure that the software requriments are met.
3. Acceptance Testing   :- It involves planning and the execution of varioustypes of tests in order to demonstrate that the implemented software system satisfies the requriments. Finally our project meets the requriments after going all the testing.
