**Introduction :

SDLC is a systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software built. SDLC process aims to produce high-quality software that meets customer expectations.The system development should be complete in the pre-defined time frame and cost. SDLC consists of a detailed plan which explains how to plan, build, and maintain specific software. Every phase of the SDLC life Cycle has its own process and deliverables that feed into the next phase. SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle and is also referred to as the Application Development life-cycle.

"Software development life cycle is about building a software (“only”) in a phased approach systematically. System development life cycle is about implementing hardware and software in a phased manner systematically. Here both the hardware and the software is considered as a system "*

**RESEARCH :

In research both the System and Software Development Life Cycle provides the phased approach systematically.
1. It offers a basis for project planning, scheduling, and estimating
2. Provides a framework for a standard set of activities and deliverables
3. It is a mechanism for project tracking and control
4. Increases visibility of project planning to all involved stakeholders of the development process
5. Increased and enhance development speed
6. Improved client relations
7. Helps you to decrease project risk and project management plan overhead
